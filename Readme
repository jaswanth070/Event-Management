I'm developing a Event Management System using Django where there are three types of user, Organizer, Participants and Volunteer, each have there respective dashboards but a hybrid Login and Signup Pages where the role is asked first later the object are created. Another thing to be notes is I'm using a UserProfile(Abstract User Type) that I defined. There are three apps currently I've created users app contains the models of these abstract user and the other users and the views in that contains the API for register and login. u_dashboards which does not contain any model but it contains the url's and views for the respected dashboards the views here will fetch the some basic dashboard data and sends it to the front-end. The event app will contain the model for the event and the API for CRUD operation on the events table.
